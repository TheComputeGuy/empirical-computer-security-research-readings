1. What are the paper's contributions and what did you like about the paper?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The paper did a user study about permissions in the android ecosystem, their design, language and effectiveness in informing/warning the users. The authors used effective methods to collect information and the study design was good.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The methodology of recruiting people targeted via internet ads was new, and it gave the authors good control over whom they sampled.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The suggestions provided by the authors in section 7 were very good too, actionable and with wide-ranging effects.  

2. What are questionable parts of the paper and its major limitations? (E.g., methodology issues, detail omissions, presentation problems)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 

3. What was unclear about the work, or what questions do you have?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It would be interesting to study the difference in responses broken down by demographics - by age, occupation (students, tech workers v/s retirees), etc.  

4. Compare and contrast this paper's user study methodology with that of the last reading (Why Johnny Can't Encrypt). Beyond things directly related to the subject matter difference (i.e., studying PGP vs Android permissions), what are methodology steps or actions taken in this study that are different than with the prior study? What are their benefits or limitations? Provide 3 notable differences. (If it helps, imagine doing a PGP usability studying following a similar methodology as in this paper, and discuss the differences.)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The first notable difference between the methodologies between two papers is that this paper talked to real users of the system, rather than first-time users like the PGP study did. Therefore, the past experiences of the users with the system made a difference with respect to how they responded and functioned.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This study also asked questions specifically focused on past behaviours and preferences, when installing various applications and the permissions that they request, behaviours about getting information from reviews and other sources, etc. This might not necessarily be possible in the PGP case, since most of email users do not need to send encrypted information over email, hence, the study itself might be their first exposure to PGP.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Another key difference, methodology-wise was the permission comprehension quiz. Now, a parallel of this could be made for the case of PGP, testing participants on their awareness about concepts involved in public-key cryptography and signing. But again, since most people are never exposed to these concepts, neither in theory nor in practice, unlike Android permissions, it might not get any statistically significant different results.
