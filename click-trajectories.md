1. What are the paper's contributions and what did you like about the paper?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The paper aims to look at the various actors in the spam e-commerce ecosystem, understanding relationships and identifying bottlenecks that can be exploited to bring these spammers down.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I personally liked the data collection methodologies that the researchers used, utilizing different feeds to get access to URLs and working on from there.  

2. What are questionable parts of the paper and its major limitations? (E.g., methodology issues, detail omissions, presentation problems)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I feel that the paper could've had some more edge to it if they had given real-world demonstration of some of the recommendations they presented - for example, they could've demonstrated taking down infrastructure vs payment providers and spoken about their findings and compared the recommendations that way.  

3. What was unclear about the work, or what questions do you have?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -  

4. Discuss examples of how understanding the economics of spam campaigns better enables defenders (perhaps considering examples beyond those highlighted in this paper).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Understanding the ever-evolving spam ecosystem is critical for defenders - to identify actors, links in the chain and potential bottlenecks, as well as to understand what will be the most impactful intervention strategy, especially the latter.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Economics and evolutions of spam campaigns will also be useful for defenders to think about possible future ways that they can evolve in, and chalk out strategies to defend against such evolution.  

5. How are spam operations similar to legitimate e-commerce businesses? How are they different?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - As spam operations start getting commoditized, with different actors gaining and selling expertise in a specific link of the chain, spam is becoming more of a business.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The spam chain now involves building and maintaining relationships with many different entities to ensure that the business goes on - be it the technology and infrastructure providers, payment processors, affiliates, last-mile fulfillment, etc. This is very much similar to what a real e-commerce business has to do to sustain itself.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Conversely though, spam-as-a-business has its own unique challenges that regular businesses don't have. Primarily this revolves around the legality of these services. Spammers do not have a lot of options in terms of switching providers if the "business relationship" goes wrong, because there are a very few of these providers themselves, as against regular businesses who can switch providers comparatively easily. These create bottlenecks in the spam business ecosystem.
