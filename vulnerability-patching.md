1. What are the paper's contributions and what did you like about the paper?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This paper looks at vulnerabilities and patching from the perspective of _shared code_, of which, multiple instances might be present in a machine, and the linear patching model does not patch the system fully if all the different instances are not patched individually. The paper studies this from the perspective of client-side vulnerabilities. 

2. What are questionable parts of the paper and its major limitations? (E.g., methodology issues, detail omissions, presentation problems)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 

3. What was unclear about the work, or what questions do you have?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The study is based off of discrete, unrelated databases with a lot of assumptions and extrapolations being made.  

4. Why might it take so long for users to apply software updates/patches?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There might be many reasons why users do no apply software updates. Some of them are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Using illegitimate software versions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Not having automatic updates turned on, and not using the software enough frequently to get notified about new updates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Not being aware of the importance of updates, or update fatigue, where an application releases many feature updates very frequently, leading to the user turning off updates, or not doing manual updates  

5. Take one of the proposed ways to improve software update mechanisms in Section 7.A, and discuss how feasible you believe it is in practice.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Considering the point "Handling inactive applications", I believe that this is a solved problem that just needs to be implemented well in practice. Most programs tend to clean up after they are done updating, and this is especially necessary in case of security updates where it is critical that old remnants do not remain on the file system. It is necessary that there's a standard, streamlined way to generate, package and install updates, so that even small software publishers can install updates and clean up old vulnerable versions in a secure manner.
